I’ve spent most of my career working in environments where complexity, uncertainty, and real consequences are the norm—systems that fail quietly before they fail loudly, and decisions that matter long after they’re made.

Over the past 25 years, I’ve built, operated, and advised companies across global medical services, critical supply chains, technology, biomedical and medical manufacturing, food production, logistics, and outdoor . I've worked with early-stage startups, led turn-arounds, and consulted mature organizations, often stepping in when systems were strained: scaling operations, correcting structural problems, or helping teams regain clarity when growth outpaced process.

I'm interested in how systems-thinking, first-principles, and design can reduce cognitive load for people doing real work, how incentives, psychology, and organizational structure shape behavior, and how small design decisions compound into either resilience or fragility over time. Much of my professional focus has been on applying first-principles thinking and systems engineering to business problems that don’t fit neatly into spreadsheets.

Outside of work, I spend time in places where mistakes are costly and comfort is optional: backcountry hunting, flying airplanes, and international travel. These environments have a way of clarifying what matters and exposing what doesn’t.

This site is a place to think in public. I write to clarify ideas, test assumptions, and document lessons learned—about business, systems, decision-making, health, and navigating complexity without unnecessary drama. The primary goal is to stay honest, precise, and grounded in real experience. My hope is that it also provides you value.
