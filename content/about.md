I run and build companies that rely on software to move people, money, and information accurately and on time. My focus is operational systems—dispatch, payroll, billing, internal tooling—and the engineering decisions that make them resilient in the real world. I’m interested in how constraints expose weak assumptions, how systems fail quietly, and how to design processes that support humans instead of fighting them. I use this space to write through problems, document decisions, and leave a durable record of what I’ve learned.
